### Mobile Main Street

Mobile Main Street is a web-based publishing tool built for sharing real-time information from multiple members within a community. Unlike other platforms, we publish directly from community member's Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, or XML feeds. This means there's no need for storytellers and community members to login to post updates â€“ it's all done automatically.
